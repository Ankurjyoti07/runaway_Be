# Runaway Be Stars
Origin of the fast rotation in Be stars are yet unknown. Two mainstream hypothesis are single star channel, where the rotation originates from contracting core of these stars and the binary channel, where the rotation is thought to have come from the angular momentum transfer during the mass transfer episodes. Runaway fractions can be used to verify how strong or relevant the binary channel might be in explaining the fast rotation in Be stars
